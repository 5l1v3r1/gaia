Gaia - primal goddess of rapid development in c++.
=====

Gaia is a set of libraries and c++ environment that allows you efficient and rapid development
in c++14 on linux systems. The focus is mostly for backend development, data processing etc.

I will gradually add explanations for most crucial blocks in this library.
For now, in order to build it, you need to install the following prerequisites:


`sudo ./install-dependencies.sh`

```
./blaze.sh -ninja && cd build-dbg
ninja -j4
```
