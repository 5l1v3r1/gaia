Gaia - primal goddess of rapid development in C++

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/romange/gaia.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/romange/gaia)
=====

Gaia is a set of libraries and c++ environment that allows you efficient and rapid development
in c++14 on linux systems. The focus is mostly for backend development, data processing etc.


1. Dependency on [abseil-cpp](https://github.com/abseil/abseil-cpp/)
2. Dependency on [Boost 1.68](https://www.boost.org/doc/libs/1_68_0/doc/html/)
3. Uses ninja-build on top of cmake
4. Build artifacts are docker-friendly.
5. Generic RPC implementation.
6. HTTP server implementation.
7. Many other features.


I will gradually add explanations for most crucial blocks in this library.


## Building, Setting Up
1. abseil is integrated as submodule. To fetch abseil run:

       git submodule update --init --recursive
2. Dependencies setup:

       sudo ./install-dependencies.sh
3. Build setup:

       ./blaze.sh -ninja -release
   *third_party* folder is checked out under build directories.
4. To build, just run ninja:

       cd build-opt && ninja -j4 asio_fibers
5. To check raw ASIO & fibers in action, run from 2 tabs:

       server> ./asio_fibers --logtostderr
       client> ./asio_fibers --connect=localhost --count 100000 --num_connections=8

To use abseil code use `#include "absl/..."`.
Third_party packages have `TRDP::` prefix in `CMakeLists.txt`. absl libraries have prefix
`absl_...`.


## RPC

In addition to better performance, new RPC supports server streaming API, fully asynchronous
processing, low-latency service. New RPC uses Boost.ASIO and Boost.Fibers
as its core libraries for asynchronous processing.

1. [IoContextPool](https://github.com/romange/gaia/blob/master/util/asio/io_context_pool.h)
is used for managing thread-per-core asynchronous engine based on ASIO.
For periodic tasks, look at `asio/period_task.h`.
2. The listening server (AcceptServer) is protocol agnostic and serves both http and RPC.
3. new RPC service methods run inside a fiber. This fiber belongs to a thread that probably serves
many other connections in the server. Using regular locking mechanisms
(`std::mutex`, `pthread_mutex`) or calling 3rd party libraries (libmysqlcpp) will block the whole thread. We need to be mindful about this, and as a policy prohibit thread blocking in fiber-based server code.
4. RPC service methods might need to issue RPC calls by themselves or block for some other reason.
To do it correctly, we must use fiber-friendly fiber-friendly synchronization routines. But even
in this case we still block the calling fiber (not thread). By default, there is one dedicated fiber per RPC connection that reads rpc requests and delegates them to the RPC application code. Please note,
that if an application code blocks during its request processing, it effectively limits total QPS per that socket connection. For spinlock use-cases (i.e. RAM access locking with rw-spinlocks) having single fiber per rpc-connection is usually enough. For more complicated cases, it's advised to implement fiber-pool (currently not implemented in GAIA).

5. Server-side streaming is needed for responses that can be very large and can easily be represented by
many smaller responses with identical interface. Think of SQL response for example.
It may consist of many rows returned by `SELECT`. Instead, of returning them as one blob, server-side streaming can send back multiple responses in the context of a single request on a wire.
Each small response is propagated to RPC client via callback based interface. As a result, both systems (client and server) are not required to hold the whole response in RAM at the same time.

While GAIA provides very efficient RPC core, it does not provide higher level RPC bindings.
It's possible though to build a layer that uses protobuf-based declaration language this RPC library.
For raw RPC demo see asio_fibers above.

## HTTP
HTTP handler is implemented using [Boost.Beast](https://www.boost.org/doc/libs/1_68_0/libs/beast/doc/html/index.html) library.
It's integrated with the IoContextPool similarly to RPC service.
Please see [http_main.cc](https://github.com/romange/gaia/blob/master/util/http/http_main.cc), for example. HTTP also provides support for backend monitoring (Varz status page) and for extensible debugging interface. With monitoring C++ backend returns json object that is formatted inside status page in the browser. To check how it looks, please go to [localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080) while `asio_fibers` are running.


### Self-profiling
Every http-powered backend has integrated CPU profiling capabilities using [gperf-tools](https://github.com/gperftools/gperftools) and [pprof](https://github.com/google/pprof)
Profiling can be trigerred in prod using magical url commands and they usually have very minimal impact
on cpu performance of the running backend.

### Logging
Logging is based on Google's [glog library](https://github.com/google/glog). The library is very reliable, performant and solid. It has many features that allow resilient backend development.
Unfortunately, Google's version has some bugs, which I fixed (waiting for review...), so I use my own fork. Glog library gives me the ability to control logging levels of a backend at run-time without restarting it.

## Tests
GAIA uses googletest+gmock unit-test environment.
